tester requests

please take your time and don't worry about delays, i want to make sure it's polished AF

please check out weathers and give feedback on transitions, and night brightness, does it rain too much? 

check towns and villages for weirdness such as grass clipping or floating lights/floating objects

give feedback on leveling and combat. is it too fast?

thank
